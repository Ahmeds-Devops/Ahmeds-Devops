| 🔍 **OCR Text Search** | Find any screenshot by searching text inside images — 95%+ accuracy across 100+ languages |
| 📜 **Scrolling Screenshot Capture** | Capture entire web pages and long documents into one seamless image |
| ☁️ **Cloud Sync & Backup** | Secure AWS S3 storage with automatic sync — never lose a screenshot |
| ⚡ **Smart Automation Rules** | Create if-then workflows to auto-categorize, tag, and organize by content/date/app |
| 🔎 **Visual Diff Comparison** | Compare two screenshots side-by-side with AI-powered pixel-perfect change detection |
| 🔒 **Secure Sharing** | Password-protected share links with expiry dates and access analytics |
| 🗂️ **Smart Collections** | Dynamic folders with 15+ auto-categories: Code, Design, Documents, Memes, and more |
| ✏️ **Built-in Editor** | Annotate, crop, blur sensitive data — professional editing tools in-app |
| 🛡️ **Privacy Protection** | Auto-blur passwords, credit cards, and personal data using AI detection |

3. **AI Auto-Organizes** — GPT-4 Vision analyzes and categorizes in real-time
4. **Search & Find** — Type any keyword, OCR reads text inside images instantly
